## Description

### Background Context

"Fix my code" is a new type of project where you will dive into existing codebases and debug them!

Sometimes you will encounter languages you are familiar with, and other times you might not.

Please download the repository [Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as the starting point for all solutions.

**The goal is not to rewrite everything, but to identify and fix the existing issues!**

**This project is entirely OPTIONAL.** Completing any part of it will add a project grade exceeding 100% to your overall average. Your score will not be negatively impacted if you choose not to participate. However, if your current average is higher than your score on this project, your average might decrease. Have fun debugging!
